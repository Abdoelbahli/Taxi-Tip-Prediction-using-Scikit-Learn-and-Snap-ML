## Introduction

The notebook provides a detailed approach to building machine learning models that predict taxi tips based on various features. We explore the use of **Scikit-Learn** as a baseline and **Snap ML** for high-performance machine learning. This project helps highlight the performance benefits of Snap ML, particularly in regression tasks.

The main objectives are:
- To preprocess and analyze the dataset.
- Build regression models using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.
- Compare the performance of the models based on speed and accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Snap ML
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Taxi-Tip-Prediction-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Snap-ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Taxi-Tip-Prediction-using-Scikit-Learn-and-Snap-ML
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Taxi Tip Prediction using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to load, preprocess, and analyze the taxi dataset.
   
   - **Model Training**: Train models using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML to predict the tip amount.
   - **Performance Comparison**: Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and analyze speed improvements.

## Dataset

The dataset contains taxi trip details, including:
- **Features**: Distance traveled, fare amount, passenger count, time of day, etc.
- **Target**: Tip amount.

Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` folder before running the notebook.

```

## Results

The notebook includes an analysis of model performance using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML. Key results include:
- Model accuracy based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Performance comparison between Scikit-Learn and Snap ML in terms of computation time.
- Visualizations of predicted vs actual tip amounts.
